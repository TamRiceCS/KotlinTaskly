### Problem Statement
Individuals often have a collection of tasks in a day that they must complete. Unfortunately, these tasks can seem overwhelming to serial procrastinators and people who suffer from mental illness. Individuals who have formed bad habits also find it hard to complete tasks. From initial surveying, when people plan out tasks for a day they encounter the following problems:
* Poor task time estimation (Severely under or overestimate the amount of time tasks will take)
* Completion Fallacy (All tasks must be completed in one go)
* Overbooking (A collection of tasks are assigned to a day that is not realistic to complete)
* No rest or down time incorporated in (Humans are not made to be productive 100% of the time and forcing high productivity can lead to burn out.)

### Audience
* Smartphone Users
* Young Adults (College Age / Early Career)
* The mentally Ill
* Procrastinators
* Our target audience is young adults (college age / early career) that are just starting to experience independence.
